D1. Inception

1. Introduction

  Our project is about making a web app that can be used by students so that they can develop a community that best fits them within the 
University they are attending. This software will be solving the problem that some students may have on campus of connecting with others 
and finding friends in university life. This can be a big problem with some students whether they be transfers or incoming freshman as 
connecting with your community can be daunting to some but being connected with life on campus can make a students college experience 
that much better.

  Michael Wooll a Transfer Student at CSU Chico studying Computer Science, interviewed by Ethan Donnelly.

  Consumer Segment
  Transfer Student
  
  Key Insights

  Very beneficial to Transfer Students
  Give students a platform to get involved
  
  Representative Quotes
  “I like this idea because as a Transfer student myself getting connected with a new University can be scary and this could be used as   a means to make that transition easier.”
  
  “Another thing that I always notice on campus is there is always tons of flyers posted on bulletin boards across campus and sometimes   you see something you would want to attend and it already happened. Sometimes you wish that you could have known about that beforehand   and this could make it easier to get event details out to students easier.”

  Hypotheses that were validated
  Michael loved this idea of an app that can connect students with their community, especially when students are in certain               circumstances where they are at a disconnect with their campus. He knows how hard it can be to connect and thinks this could be a good   way to do so.

  Cameron McCathern, NAU Graduate, BFA
  
  When?
  February 12th, 2020
  
  Consumer Segment
  Transfer Student

  Being more connected with events on campus in one location.
  Having information a student would need in a working web layout.
  
  Representative Quotes
  “Almost every time I would try to navigate through NAU’s website to find what I’m looking for, I 
  would almost always find broken links. There are too many ways to get to the same place and it is 
  very confusing.”
  
  Hypotheses that were validated
  It seemed my interviewee was not too interested in the social media aspect, but the idea of keeping 
  all of the needed information in one concise location, which lines up with our statement of  
  “...making life on campus more convenient”.
