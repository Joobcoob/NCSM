D1. Inception

1. Introduction

  Our project is about making a web app that can be used by students so that they can develop a community that best fits them within the 
University they are attending. This software will be solving the problem that some students may have on campus of connecting with others 
and finding friends in university life. This can be a big problem with some students whether they be transfers or incoming freshman as 
connecting with your community can be daunting to some but being connected with life on campus can make a students college experience 
that much better.

  Consumer Segment
  Transfer Student
  
  Key Insights
  Being more connected with events on campus in one location.
  Having information a student would need in a working web layout.
  
  Representative Quotes
  "Almost every time I would try to navigate through NAU's website to find what I'm looking for, I 
  would almost always find broken links. There are too many ways to get to the same place and it is
  very confusing."
  
  Hypotheses that were validated
  It seems my interviewee was not too interested in the social media aspect, but the idea of keeing
  all of the needed information in one concise location, which lines up with our statement of "...
  making life on campus more conveinient".
  
  Assesment
  Nice to have
